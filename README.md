# Project-NLS
a website about north louth services, a local company in County Louth, ireland. 
I have selected this company as my project material because i have worked there for approx 12 years and have enough knowledge on the company to avoid researching it and focusing more time on my coding. 
My plan with this website design is to have a simple, informing and interactive approach to this company.
I also wanted to make use of my newly gathered HTML and CSS knowledge and use a lot of different elements ands methods.
