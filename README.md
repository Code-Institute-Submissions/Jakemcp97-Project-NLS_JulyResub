# Project-NLS
a website about north louth services, a local company in County Louth, ireland. 
I have selected this company as my project material because i have worked there for approximately 12 years and have enough knowledge on the company to avoid researching it and focusing more time on my coding. 

## Scope
My plan with this website design is to have a simple, informing and interactive approach to this company.
I also wanted to make use of my newly gathered HTML and CSS knowledge and use a lot of different elements ands methods. 

## plans verus final outcome
I originally started to design and create this website based on one of the templates suggested as part of code institute, but i found the design process quite difficult as im not overly creative. While talking to friends regarding this someone suggested making a website for my current employer which i thought was a great idea and so completely restarted and redesigned the project. I'm quite happy with the current state of my website but feel there is more i could do to improve once my knowledge of coding has expanded.
